    (description
     "GNU Moe is a powerful-but-simple-to-use text editor.  It works in a
modeless manner, and features an intuitive set of key-bindings that
assign a degree of severity to each key; for example, key
combinations with the Alt key are for harmless commands like cursor
movements while combinations with the Control key are for commands
that will modify the text.  Moe features multiple windows, unlimited
undo/redo, unlimited line length, global search and replace, and
more.")
