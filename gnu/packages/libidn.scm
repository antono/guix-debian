   (description
    "GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA specifications. Libidn's purpose is to encode and decode
internationalised domain names.

The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation. Profiles for
Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included. Punycode and
ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported. A mechanism to
define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation tables, and to compare
strings against those tables, is included.
Default tables for some TLDs are also included.")
