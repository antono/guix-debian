     "MCrypt is a replacement for the old crypt() package and crypt(1)
command, with extensions.  It allows developers to use a wide range of
encryption functions, without making drastic changes to their code.  It allows
users to encrypt files or data streams without having to be cryptographers.
The companion to MCrypt is Libmcrypt, which contains the actual encryption
functions themselves, and provides a standardized mechanism for accessing
them.")

     "mhash is a thread-safe hash library, implemented in C, and provides a
uniform interface to a large number of hash algorithms. These algorithms can
be used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures. The HMAC
support implements the basics for message authentication, following RFC 2104.

Algorithms currently supplied are:

CRC-32, CRC-32B, ALDER-32, MD-2, MD-4, MD-5, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160,
RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, HAVAL-128,
