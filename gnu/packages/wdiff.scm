    (description
     "GNU Wdiff is a front end to 'diff' for comparing files on a word per
word basis.  A word is anything between whitespace.  This is useful for
comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed and for which
paragraphs have been refilled.  It works by creating two temporary files, one
word per line, and then executes 'diff' on these files.  It collects the
'diff' output and uses it to produce a nicer display of word differences
between the original files.")
