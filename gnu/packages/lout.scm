    (description
"The Lout document formatting system is now reads a high-level description of
a document similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript or plain text
output file.

Lout offers an unprecedented range of advanced features, including optimal
paragraph and page breaking, automatic hyphenation, PostScript EPS file
inclusion and generation, equation formatting, tables, diagrams, rotation and
scaling, sorted indexes, bibliographic databases, running headers and
odd-even pages, automatic cross referencing, multilingual documents including
hyphenation (most European languages are supported), formatting of computer
programs, and much more, all ready to use.  Furthermore, Lout is easily
extended with definitions which are very much easier to write than troff of
TeX macros because Lout is a high-level, purely functional language, the
outcome of an eight-year research project that went back to the
beginning.")
