    (description
     "GNU Cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive. The
archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.

GNU Cpio supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII, new
ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar. The
tar format is provided for compatability with the tar program. By
default, cpio creates binary format archives, for compatibility with
older cpio programs. When extracting from archives, cpio automatically
recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can read archives
created on machines with a different byte-order.")
