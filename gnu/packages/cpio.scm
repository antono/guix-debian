    (description
     "GNU cpio copies files into or out of cpio or tar archives. Indeed,
many formats are supported, including legacy formats.  The format is
determined automatically by the program and is handled appropriately. 
Furthermore, the location of the archive is not important.  It can be another
file on the drive, a tape, or data on a pipe.")
