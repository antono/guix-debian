    (description
     "GNU Screen is a terminal window manager that multiplexes a single
terminal between several processes.  The virtual terminals each provide
features such as a scroll-back buffer and a copy-and-paste mechanism.  Screen
then manages the different virtual terminals, allowing you to easily switch
between them, to detach them from the current session, or even splitting the
view to show two terminals at once.")
