    (description
     "Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.  Lua
combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs
based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,
runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has
automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal
for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.")
