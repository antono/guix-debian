     "Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed
network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents
somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you
visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical
location. Tor works with many of your existing applications, including
web browsers, instant messaging clients, remote login, and other
applications based on the TCP protocol.")
