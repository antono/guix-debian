   (description
    "GNU M4 is an implementation of the M4 macro language, which features
some extensions over other implementations, some of which are required by GNU
Autoconf.  It is used as a macro processor, which means it processes text,
expanding macros as it encounters them.  It also has some built-in functions,
for example to run shell commands or to do arithmetic.")
