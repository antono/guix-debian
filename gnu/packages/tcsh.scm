     "Tcsh is an enhanced, but completely compatible version of the Berkeley
UNIX C shell (csh). It is a command language interpreter usable both as an
interactive login shell and a shell script command processor. It includes a
command-line editor, programmable word completion, spelling correction, a
history mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.")
