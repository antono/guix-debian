This patch fixes SLiM so it really waits for the X server to be ready
before attempting to connect to it.  Indeed, the X server notices that
its parent process has a handler for SIGUSR1, and consequently sends it
SIGUSR1 when it's ready to accept connections.

The problem was that SLiM doesn't pay attention to SIGUSR1.  So in practice,
if X starts slowly, then SLiM gets ECONNREFUSED a couple of time on
/tmp/.X11-unix/X0, then goes on trying to connect to localhost:6000,
where nobody answers; eventually, it times out and tries again on
/tmp/.X11-unix/X0, and finally it shows up on the screen.
