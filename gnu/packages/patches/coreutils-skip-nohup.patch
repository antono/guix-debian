    tests: fix false failure in nohup.sh in non tty builds
    
    * tests/misc/nohup.sh: When running tests without a controlling tty,
    an exec failure is triggered in a subshell, which causes POSIX
    shells to immediately exit the subshell.  This was brought
    to notice by the newly conforming bash 4.3.
    Fixes http:/bugs.gnu.org/16940
