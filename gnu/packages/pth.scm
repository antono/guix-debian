    (description
     "GNU Pth is a portable library providing non-preemptive, priority-based
scheduling for multiple execution threads.  Each thread has its own
program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable. Threads are
scheduled in a cooperative way, rather than in the standard preemptive way,
such that they are managed according to priority and events.  However, Pth
also features emulation of POSIX.1c threads (\"pthreads\") for backwards
compatibility.")
