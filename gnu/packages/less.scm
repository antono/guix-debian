    (description
     "GNU less is a pager, a program that allows you to view large amounts
of text in page-sized chunks.  Unlike traditional pagers, it allows both
backwards and forwards movement through the document.  It also does not have
to read the entire input file before starting, so it starts faster than most
text editors.")
