    (description
     "GNU less is a program similar to more, but which allows backward
movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not
have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
files it starts up faster than text editors like vi. Less uses
termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.")
