    (description "FLTK is a C++ GUI toolkit providing modern GUI functionality without the
bloat. It supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation.
FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically linked, but
works fine as a shared library. FLTK also includes an excellent UI builder
called FLUID that can be used to create applications in minutes.")
