    (description
     "GNU Ddrescue is a data recovery tool.  It copies data from one
file or block device (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM) to another, trying hard to
rescue data in case of read errors.

The basic operation of Ddrescue is fully automatic.  That is, you don't
have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, run it in
reverse mode, etc.

If you use the logfile feature of Ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently (only the needed blocks are read).  Also, you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.

Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file and run Ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with the same
output file, you will probably obtain a complete and error-free file.")
