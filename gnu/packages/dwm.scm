    (synopsis "Dynamic window manager")
    (description
     "dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled,
monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied dynamically,
optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

In tiled layout windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains the window which currently needs most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In monocle layout all windows are
maximised to the screen size. In floating layout windows can be resized and
moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating, regardless of the
layout applied.

Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.

Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
layout, the number of visible windows, the title of the focused window, and the
text read from the root window name property, if the screen is focused. A
floating window is indicated with an empty square and a maximised floating
window is indicated with a filled square before the windows title. The selected
tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of the focused window are
indicated with a filled square in the top left corner. The tags which are
applied to one or more windows are indicated with an empty square in the top
left corner.

dwm draws a small customizable border around windows to indicate the focus
state.")
