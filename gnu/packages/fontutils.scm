anti-aliased glyph bitmap generation with 256 gray levels.")

GLYPH. This special GLYPH-type is also used in the X11 window system to
describe character bitmaps. It contains the bitmap data as well as some

   (synopsis "TECkit, a toolkit for encoding conversions")
   (description
    "TECkit is a low-level toolkit intended to be used by other applications
that need to perform encoding conversions (e.g., when importing legacy data
into a Unicode-based application). The primary component of the TECkit
package is therefore a library that performs conversions; this is the
\"TECkit engine\". The engine relies on mapping tables in a specific binary
format (for which documentation is available); there is a compiler that
creates such tables from a human-readable mapping description (a simple
text file).

To facilitate the development and testing of mapping tables for TECkit,
several applications are also included in the current package; these
include simple tools for applying conversions to plain-text and Standard
Format files, as well as both command-line and simple GUI versions of the
TECkit compiler. However, it is not intended that these tools will be the
primary means by which end users perform conversions, and they have not
been designed, tested, and debugged to the extent that general-purpose
applications should be.")
