   (description
    "rsync is a fast and versatile file copying tool. It can copy locally,
to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon.
Its delta-transfer algorithm reduces the amount of data sent over the network
by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing
files in the destination.")
