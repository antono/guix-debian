   (synopsis "Simple Authentication and Security Layer library")
   (description
    "GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security
Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network
servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication from clients, and in
clients to authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL consists of a library (libgsasl), a command line utility (gsasl)
to access the library from the shell, and a manual. The library includes
support for the framework (with authentication functions and application
data privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial support for the
CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5,
SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, LOGIN, and NTLM mechanisms.

The library is portable because it does not do network communication by
itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling application. The library is
flexible with regards to the authorization infrastructure used, as it
utilises callbacks into the application to decide whether an user is
authorised or not.

The gsasl package distribution includes the library part as well,
so there is no need to install two packages.")
