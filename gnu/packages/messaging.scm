     "OTR allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging by
providing:
* Encryption: No one else can read your instant messages.
* Authentication: You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
* Deniability: The messages you send do not have digital signatures that are
  checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a conversation
  to make them look like they came from you.  However, during a conversation,
  your correspondent is assured the messages he sees are authentic and
  unmodified.
* Perfect forward secrecy: If you lose control of your private keys, no
  previous conversation is compromised.")
