    (description
     "Fish (friendly interactive shell) is a shell focused on interactive use,
discoverability, and friendliness.  Fish has very user-friendly and powerful
tab-completion, including descriptions of every completion, completion of
strings with wildcards, and many completions for specific commands.  It also
has extensive and discoverable help.  A special help command gives access to
all the fish documentation in your web browser. Other features include smart
terminal handling based on terminfo, an easy to search history, and syntax
highlighting. ")
