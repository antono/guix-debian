    (description
     "GNU Serveez is a server framework providing the routines necessary to
easily implement IP-based servers in your application.  It
demonstrates aspects of network programming in a portable manner,
making it convenient for both simplifying the process of adding a
server to your application or for learning about how network services
work.  Several example servers are provided already, such as an HTTP
server and an IRC server.")
