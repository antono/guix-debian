     "Hash library of database functions compatible with traditional dbm")
    (description
     "GNU dbm (or GDBM, for short) is a library of database functions
that use extensible hashing and work similar to the standard UNIX dbm.
These routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and
manipulate a hashed database.

The basic use of GDBM is to store key/data pairs in a data file.  Each
key must be unique and each key is paired with only one data item.

The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs, searching
and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key along with its
data.  It also support sequential iteration over all key/data pairs in a
database.

For compatibility with programs using old UNIX dbm function, the package
also provides traditional dbm and ndbm interfaces.")
