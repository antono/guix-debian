    (synopsis "Tools and documentation for translation")
    (description
     "Usually, programs are written and documented in English, and use
English at execution time for interacting with users.  Using a common
language is quite handy for communication between developers,
maintainers and users from all countries.  On the other hand, most
people are less comfortable with English than with their own native
language, and would rather be using their mother tongue for day to
day's work, as far as possible.  Many would simply love seeing their
computer screen showing a lot less of English, and far more of their
own language.

GNU `gettext' is an important step for the GNU Translation Project, as
bit is an asset on which we may build many other steps. This package
offers to programmers, translators, and even users, a well integrated
set of tools and documentation. Specifically, the GNU `gettext'
utilities are a set of tools that provides a framework to help other
GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages.")
