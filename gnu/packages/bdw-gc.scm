   (synopsis "The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector
for C and C++")
   (description
    "The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used
as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new.  It allows
you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without
explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful.  The collector
automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer
be otherwise accessed.

The collector is also used by a number of programming language
implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want to
facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the
simple collector interface.

Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a leak detector for
C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.")
