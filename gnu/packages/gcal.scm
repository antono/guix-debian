    (description
     "Gcal is a program to calculate and print calendars on the
command-line.  Calendars can be printed in 1-month, 3-month or whole-year
views. In addition, eternal holiday lists can be generated for many
countries, which can be complemented by user-made lists of fixed dates to
make an agenda.  Gcal can also calculate astronomical data, such as the
phases of the moon, and supports alternative calendar formats: Julian,
Gregorian, Islamic, Chinese and more.")
