    (description
     "GNU Zile, which is a lightweight Emacs clone.  Zile is short
for Zile Is Lossy Emacs.  Zile has been written to be as
similar as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at
home.

Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit
clean (though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the
number of editing buffers and windows is only limited by
available memory and screen space respectively.  Registers,
minibuffer completion and auto fill are available.  Function
and variable names are identical with Emacs's (except those
containing the word \"emacs\", which instead contain the word
\"zile\"!).

However, all of this is packed into a program which typically
compiles to about 130Kb.")
