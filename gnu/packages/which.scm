    (description
     "GNU Which takes one or more arguments. For each of its arguments
it prints to stdout the full path of the executables that would have
been executed when this argument had been entered at the shell
prompt. It does this by searching for an executable or script in the
directories listed in the environment variable PATH using the same
algorithm as bash(1).")
