    (description
     "GNU Aspell is a free spell checker designed to eventually replace
Ispell.  It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell
checker.  Its main feature is that it does a superior job of suggesting
possible replacements for a misspelled word than just about any other
spell checker out there for the English language.  Unlike Ispell, Aspell
can also easily check documents in UTF-8 without having to use a special
dictionary.  Aspell will also do its best to respect the current locale
setting.  Other advantages over Ispell include support for using
multiple dictionaries at once and intelligently handling personal
dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once.")
