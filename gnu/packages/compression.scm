that is, not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library for
use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system.  The zlib data
format is itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method
used in Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method
currently used in zlib essentially never expands the data. (LZW can double or
triple the file size in extreme cases.)  zlib's memory footprint is also
independent of the input data and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost
in compression.")

    "gzip (GNU zip) is a popular data compression program written by Jean-loup
Gailly for the GNU project.  Mark Adler wrote the decompression part.

We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of the Unisys
and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by compress.  These patents
made it impossible for us to use compress, and we needed a replacement.  The
superior compression ratio of gzip is just a bonus.")
