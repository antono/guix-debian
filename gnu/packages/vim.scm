    (description
     "Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text
editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX
systems.

Vim is often called a \"programmer's editor,\" and so useful for programming
that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim
is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing
configuration files. ")
