1 Introduction
**************

GNU Guix(1) is a functional package management tool for the GNU system.
Package management consists of all activities that relate to building
packages from sources, honoring their build-time and run-time
dependencies, installing packages in user environments, upgrading
installed packages to new versions or rolling back to a previous set,
removing unused software packages, etc.

   The term "functional" refers to a specific package management
discipline.  In Guix, the package build and installation process is seen
as a function, in the mathematical sense.  That function takes inputs,
such as build scripts, a compiler, and libraries, and returns an
installed package.  As a pure function, its result depends solely on its
inputs—for instance, it cannot refer to software or scripts that were
not explicitly passed as inputs.  A build function always produces the
same result when passed a given set of inputs.  It cannot alter the
system’s environment in any way; for instance, it cannot create, modify,
or delete files outside of its build and installation directories.  This
is achieved by running build processes in isolated environments (or
"chroots"), where only their explicit inputs are visible.

   The result of package build functions is "cached" in the file system,
in a special directory called "the store" (*note The Store::).  Each
package is installed in a directory of its own, in the store—by default
under ‘/nix/store’.  The directory name contains a hash of all the
inputs used to build that package; thus, changing an input yields a
different directory name.

   This approach is the foundation of Guix’s salient features: support
for transactional package upgrade and rollback, per-user installation,
and garbage collection of packages (*note Features::).

   Guix has a command-line interface, which allows users to build,
install, upgrade, and remove packages, as well as a Scheme programming
interface.

   Last but not least, Guix is used to build a distribution of the GNU
system, with many GNU and non-GNU free software packages.  *Note GNU
Distribution::.

2 Installation
**************

GNU Guix is available for download from its website at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/>.  This section describes the
software requirements of Guix, as well as how to install it and get
ready to use it.

   The build procedure for Guix is the same as for other GNU software,
and is not covered here.  Please see the files ‘README’ and ‘INSTALL’ in
the Guix source tree for additional details.

* Invoking guix-daemon::        Running the build daemon.


File: guix.info,  Node: Requirements,  Next: Setting Up the Daemon,  Up: Installation

2.1 Requirements
================

GNU Guix depends on the following packages:

   • GNU Guile (http://gnu.org/software/guile/), version 2.0.5 or later;
   • GNU libgcrypt (http://gnupg.org/)

   Unless ‘--disable-daemon’ was passed to ‘configure’, the following
packages are also needed:

   • SQLite 3 (http://sqlite.org)
   • libbz2 (http://www.bzip.org)
   • GCC’s g++ (http://gcc.gnu.org)

   When a working installation of the Nix package manager
(http://nixos.org/nix/) is available, you can instead configure Guix
with ‘--disable-daemon’.  In that case, Nix replaces the three
dependencies above.

   Guix is compatible with Nix, so it is possible to share the same
store between both.  To do so, you must pass ‘configure’ not only the
same ‘--with-store-dir’ value, but also the same ‘--localstatedir’
value.  The latter is essential because it specifies where the database
that stores metadata about the store is located, among other things.
The default values are ‘--with-store-dir=/nix/store’ and
‘--localstatedir=/nix/var’.  Note that ‘--disable-daemon’ is not
required if your goal is to share the store with Nix.


File: guix.info,  Node: Setting Up the Daemon,  Next: Invoking guix-daemon,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Installation

2.2 Setting Up the Daemon
=========================

Operations such as building a package or running the garbage collector
are all performed by a specialized process, the "Guix daemon", on behalf
of clients.  Only the daemon may access the store and its associated
database.  Thus, any operation that manipulates the store goes through
the daemon.  For instance, command-line tools such as ‘guix package’ and
‘guix build’ communicate with the daemon (via remote procedure calls) to
instruct it what to do.

   In a standard multi-user setup, Guix and its daemon—the ‘guix-daemon’
program—are installed by the system administrator; ‘/nix/store’ is owned
by ‘root’ and ‘guix-daemon’ runs as ‘root’.  Unprivileged users may use
Guix tools to build packages or otherwise access the store, and the
daemon will do it on their behalf, ensuring that the store is kept in a
consistent state, and allowing built packages to be shared among users.

   When ‘guix-daemon’ runs as ‘root’, you may not want package build
processes themselves to run as ‘root’ too, for obvious security reasons.
To avoid that, a special pool of "build users" should be created for use
by build processes started by the daemon.  These build users need not
have a shell and a home directory: they will just be used when the
daemon drops ‘root’ privileges in build processes.  Having several such
users allows the daemon to launch distinct build processes under
separate UIDs, which guarantees that they do not interfere with each
other—an essential feature since builds are regarded as pure functions
(*note Introduction::).

   On a GNU/Linux system, a build user pool may be created like this
(using Bash syntax and the ‘shadow’ commands):

     # groupadd guix-builder
     # for i in `seq 1 10`;
       do
         useradd -g guix-builder -G guix-builder           \
                 -d /var/empty -s `which nologin`          \
                 -c "Guix build user $i" guix-builder$i;
       done

The ‘guix-daemon’ program may then be run as ‘root’ with:

     # guix-daemon --build-users-group=guix-builder

This way, the daemon starts build processes in a chroot, under one of
the ‘guix-builder’ users.  On GNU/Linux, by default, the chroot
environment contains nothing but the ‘/dev’ and ‘/proc’ directories(1).

   Guix may also be used in a single-user setup, with ‘guix-daemon’
running as an unprivileged user.  However, to maximize non-interference
of build processes, the daemon still needs to perform certain operations
that are restricted to ‘root’ on GNU/Linux: it should be able to run
build processes in a chroot, and to run them under different UIDs.  To
that end, the ‘nix-setuid-helper’ program is provided; it is a small C
program (less than 300 lines) that, if it is made setuid ‘root’, can be
executed by the daemon to perform these operations on its behalf.  The
‘root’-owned ‘/etc/nix-setuid.conf’ file is read by ‘nix-setuid-helper’;
it should contain exactly two words: the user name under which the
authorized ‘guix-daemon’ runs, and the name of the build users group.

   If you are installing Guix as an unprivileged user and do not have
the ability to make ‘nix-setuid-helper’ setuid-‘root’, it is still
possible to run ‘guix-daemon’.  However, build processes will not be
isolated from one another, and not from the rest of the system.  Thus,
build processes may interfere with each other, and may access programs,
libraries, and other files available on the system—making it much harder
to view them as _pure_ functions.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On some systems ‘/dev/shm’, which supports shared memory, is a
symlink to another directory such as ‘/run/shm’, that is _not_ is the
chroot.  When that is the case, shared memory support is unavailable in
the chroot environment.  The workaround is to make sure that ‘/dev/shm’
is directly a ‘tmpfs’ mount point.

2.3 Invoking ‘guix-daemon’
==========================

The ‘guix-daemon’ program implements all the functionality to access the
store.  This includes launching build processes, running the garbage
collector, querying the availability of a build result, etc.  It is
normally run as ‘root’ like this:

     # guix-daemon --build-users-group=guix-builder

For details on how to set it up, *note Setting Up the Daemon::.

   By default, ‘guix-daemon’ launches build processes under different
UIDs, taken from the build group specified with ‘--build-users-group’.
In addition, each build process is run in a chroot environment that only
contains the subset of the store that the build process depends on, as
specified by its derivation (*note derivation: Programming Interface.),
plus a set of specific system directories.  By default, the latter
contains ‘/dev’ and ‘/dev/pts’.

   The following command-line options are supported:

‘--build-users-group=GROUP’
     Take users from GROUP to run build processes (*note build users:
     Setting Up the Daemon.).

‘--no-substitutes’
     Do not use substitutes for build products.  That is, always build
     things locally instead of allowing downloads of pre-built binaries.

‘--cache-failures’
     Cache build failures.  By default, only successful builds are
     cached.

‘--cores=N’
‘-c N’
     Use N CPU cores to build each derivation; ‘0’ means as many as
     available.

     The default value is ‘1’, but it may be overridden by clients, such
     as the ‘--cores’ option of ‘guix build’ (*note Invoking guix
     build::).

     The effect is to define the ‘NIX_BUILD_CORES’ environment variable
     in the build process, which can then use it to exploit internal
     parallelism—for instance, by running ‘make -j$NIX_BUILD_CORES’.

‘--max-jobs=N’
‘-M N’
     Allow at most N build jobs in parallel.  The default value is ‘1’.

‘--debug’
     Produce debugging output.

     This is useful to debug daemon start-up issues, but then it may be
     overridden by clients, for example the ‘--verbosity’ option of
     ‘guix build’ (*note Invoking guix build::).

‘--chroot-directory=DIR’
     Add DIR to the build chroot.

     Doing this may change the result of build processes—for instance if
     they use optional dependencies found in DIR when it is available,
     and not otherwise.  For that reason, it is not recommended to do
     so.  Instead, make sure that each derivation declares all the
     inputs that it needs.

‘--disable-chroot’
     Disable chroot builds.

     Using this option is not recommended since, again, it would allow
     build processes to gain access to undeclared dependencies.

‘--disable-log-compression’
     Disable compression of the build logs.

     Unless ‘--lose-logs’ is used, all the build logs are kept in the
     LOCALSTATEDIR.  To save space, the daemon automatically compresses
     them with bzip2 by default.  This option disables that.

‘--disable-store-optimization’
     Disable automatic file “deduplication” in the store.

     By default, files added to the store are automatically
     “deduplicated”: if a newly added file is identical as another one
     found in the store, the daemon makes the new file a hard link to
     the other file.  This slightly increases the input/output load at
     the end of a build process.  This option disables this.

‘--impersonate-linux-2.6’
     On Linux-based systems, impersonate Linux 2.6.  This means that the
     kernel’s ‘uname’ system call will report 2.6 as the release number.

     This might be helpful to build programs that (usually wrongfully)
     depend on the kernel version number.

‘--lose-logs’
     Do not keep build logs.  By default they are kept under
     ‘LOCALSTATEDIR/nix/log’.

‘--system=SYSTEM’
     Assume SYSTEM as the current system type.  By default it is the
     architecture/kernel pair found at configure time, such as
     ‘x86_64-linux’.

‘--listen=SOCKET’
     Listen for connections on SOCKET, the file name of a Unix-domain
     socket.  The default socket is
     ‘LOCALSTATEDIR/daemon-socket/socket’.  This option is only useful
     in exceptional circumstances, such as if you need to run several
     daemons on the same machine.

3 Package Management
********************

The purpose of GNU Guix is to allow users to easily install, upgrade,
and remove software packages, without having to know about their build
procedure or dependencies.  Guix also goes beyond this obvious set of
features.

   This chapter describes the main features of Guix, as well as the
package management tools it provides.

File: guix.info,  Node: Features,  Next: Invoking guix package,  Up: Package Management

3.1 Features
============

When using Guix, each package ends up in the "package store", in its own
directory—something that resembles ‘/nix/store/xxx-package-1.2’, where
‘xxx’ is a base32 string.

   Instead of referring to these directories, users have their own
"profile", which points to the packages that they actually want to use.
These profiles are stored within each user’s home directory, at
‘$HOME/.guix-profile’.

   For example, ‘alice’ installs GCC 4.7.2.  As a result,
‘/home/alice/.guix-profile/bin/gcc’ points to
‘/nix/store/…-gcc-4.7.2/bin/gcc’.  Now, on the same machine, ‘bob’ had
already installed GCC 4.8.0.  The profile of ‘bob’ simply continues to
point to ‘/nix/store/…-gcc-4.8.0/bin/gcc’—i.e., both versions of GCC
coexist on the same system without any interference.

   The ‘guix package’ command is the central tool to manage packages
(*note Invoking guix package::).  It operates on those per-user
profiles, and can be used _with normal user privileges_.

   The command provides the obvious install, remove, and upgrade
operations.  Each invocation is actually a _transaction_: either the
specified operation succeeds, or nothing happens.  Thus, if the ‘guix
package’ process is terminated during the transaction, or if a power
outage occurs during the transaction, then the user’s profile remains in
its previous state, and remains usable.

   In addition, any package transaction may be _rolled back_.  So, if,
for example, an upgrade installs a new version of a package that turns
out to have a serious bug, users may roll back to the previous instance
of their profile, which was known to work well.

   All those packages in the package store may be _garbage-collected_.
Guix can determine which packages are still referenced by the user
profiles, and remove those that are provably no longer referenced (*note
Invoking guix gc::).  Users may also explicitly remove old generations
of their profile so that the packages they refer to can be collected.

   Finally, Guix takes a "purely functional" approach to package
management, as described in the introduction (*note Introduction::).
Each ‘/nix/store’ package directory name contains a hash of all the
inputs that were used to build that package—compiler, libraries, build
scripts, etc.  This direct correspondence allows users to make sure a
given package installation matches the current state of their
distribution, and helps maximize "reproducibility".

   This foundation allows Guix to support "transparent binary/source
deployment".  When a pre-built binary for a ‘/nix/store’ path is
available from an external source, Guix just downloads it; otherwise, it
builds the package from source, locally.

3.2 Invoking ‘guix package’
===========================

The ‘guix package’ command is the tool that allows users to install,
upgrade, and remove packages, as well as rolling back to previous
configurations.  It operates only on the user’s own profile, and works
with normal user privileges (*note Features::).  Its syntax is:

     guix package OPTIONS

   Primarily, OPTIONS specifies the operations to be performed during
the transaction.  Upon completion, a new profile is created, but
previous generations of the profile remain available, should the user
want to roll back.

   For each user, a symlink to the user’s default profile is
automatically created in ‘$HOME/.guix-profile’.  This symlink always
points to the current generation of the user’s default profile.  Thus,
users can add ‘$HOME/.guix-profile/bin’ to their ‘PATH’ environment
variable, and so on.

   In a multi-user setup, user profiles must be stored in a place
registered as a "garbage-collector root", which ‘$HOME/.guix-profile’
points to (*note Invoking guix gc::).  That directory is normally
‘LOCALSTATEDIR/profiles/per-user/USER’, where LOCALSTATEDIR is the value
passed to ‘configure’ as ‘--localstatedir’, and USER is the user name.
It must be created by ‘root’, with USER as the owner.  When it does not
exist, or is not owned by USER, ‘guix package’ emits an error about it.

   The OPTIONS can be among the following:

‘--install=PACKAGE’
‘-i PACKAGE’
     Install PACKAGE.

     PACKAGE may specify either a simple package name, such as ‘guile’,
     or a package name followed by a hyphen and version number, such as
     ‘guile-1.8.8’.  If no version number is specified, the newest
     available version will be selected.  In addition, PACKAGE may
     contain a colon, followed by the name of one of the outputs of the
     package, as in ‘gcc:doc’ or ‘binutils-2.22:lib’ (*note Packages
     with Multiple Outputs::).

     Sometimes packages have "propagated inputs": these are dependencies
     that automatically get installed along with the required package.

     An example is the GNU MPC library: its C header files refer to
     those of the GNU MPFR library, which in turn refer to those of the
     GMP library.  Thus, when installing MPC, the MPFR and GMP libraries
     also get installed in the profile; removing MPC also removes MPFR
     and GMP—unless they had also been explicitly installed
     independently.

     Besides, packages sometimes rely on the definition of environment
     variables for their search paths (see explanation of
     ‘--search-paths’ below).  Any missing or possibly incorrect
     environment variable definitions are reported here.

     Finally, when installing a GNU package, the tool reports the
     availability of a newer upstream version.  In the future, it may
     provide the option of installing directly from the upstream
     version, even if that version is not yet in the distribution.

‘--install-from-expression=EXP’
‘-e EXP’
     Install the package EXP evaluates to.

     EXP must be a Scheme expression that evaluates to a ‘<package>’
     object.  This option is notably useful to disambiguate between
     same-named variants of a package, with expressions such as ‘(@ (gnu
     packages base) guile-final)’.

     Note that this option installs the first output of the specified
     package, which may be insufficient when needing a specific output
     of a multiple-output package.

‘--remove=PACKAGE’
‘-r PACKAGE’
     Remove PACKAGE.

‘--upgrade[=REGEXP]’
‘-u [REGEXP]’
     Upgrade all the installed packages.  When REGEXP is specified,
     upgrade only installed packages whose name matches REGEXP.

     Note that this upgrades package to the latest version of packages
     found in the distribution currently installed.  To update your
     distribution, you should regularly run ‘guix pull’ (*note Invoking
     guix pull::).

‘--roll-back’
     Roll back to the previous "generation" of the profile—i.e., undo
     the last transaction.

     When combined with options such as ‘--install’, roll back occurs
     before any other actions.

     When rolling back from the first generation that actually contains
     installed packages, the profile is made to point to the "zeroth
     generation", which contains no files apart from its own meta-data.

     Installing, removing, or upgrading packages from a generation that
     has been rolled back to overwrites previous future generations.
     Thus, the history of a profile’s generations is always linear.

‘--search-paths’
     Report environment variable definitions, in Bash syntax, that may
     be needed in order to use the set of installed packages.  These
     environment variables are used to specify "search paths" for files
     used by some of the installed packages.

     For example, GCC needs the ‘CPATH’ and ‘LIBRARY_PATH’ environment
     variables to be defined so it can look for headers and libraries in
     the user’s profile (*note (gcc)Environment Variables::).  If GCC
     and, say, the C library are installed in the profile, then
     ‘--search-paths’ will suggest setting these variables to
     ‘PROFILE/include’ and ‘PROFILE/lib’, respectively.

‘--profile=PROFILE’
‘-p PROFILE’
     Use PROFILE instead of the user’s default profile.

‘--dry-run’
‘-n’
     Show what would be done without actually doing it.

‘--fallback’
     When substituting a pre-built binary fails, fall back to building
     packages locally.

‘--no-substitutes’
‘--max-silent-time=SECONDS’
     Same as for ‘guix build’ (*note Invoking guix build::).

‘--verbose’
     Produce verbose output.  In particular, emit the environment’s
     build log on the standard error port.

‘--bootstrap’
     Use the bootstrap Guile to build the profile.  This option is only
     useful to distribution developers.

   In addition to these actions ‘guix package’ supports the following
options to query the current state of a profile, or the availability of
packages:

‘--search=REGEXP’
‘-s REGEXP’
     List the available packages whose synopsis or description matches
     REGEXP.  Print all the meta-data of matching packages in ‘recutils’
     format (*note GNU recutils databases: (recutils)Top.).

     This allows specific fields to be extracted using the ‘recsel’
     command, for instance:

          $ guix package -s malloc | recsel -p name,version
          name: glibc
          version: 2.17

          name: libgc
          version: 7.2alpha6

‘--list-installed[=REGEXP]’
‘-I [REGEXP]’
     List the currently installed packages in the specified profile,
     with the most recently installed packages shown last.  When REGEXP
     is specified, list only installed packages whose name matches
     REGEXP.

     For each installed package, print the following items, separated by
     tabs: the package name, its version string, the part of the package
     that is installed (for instance, ‘out’ for the default output,
     ‘include’ for its headers, etc.), and the path of this package in
     the store.

‘--list-available[=REGEXP]’
‘-A [REGEXP]’
     List packages currently available in the software distribution
     (*note GNU Distribution::).  When REGEXP is specified, list only
     installed packages whose name matches REGEXP.

     For each package, print the following items separated by tabs: its
     name, its version string, the parts of the package (*note Packages
     with Multiple Outputs::), and the source location of its
     definition.

‘--list-generations[=PATTERN]’
‘-l [PATTERN]’
     Return a list of generations along with their creation dates; for
     each generation, show the installed packages, with the most
     recently installed packages shown last.  Note that the zeroth
     generation is never shown.

     For each installed package, print the following items, separated by
     tabs: the name of a package, its version string, the part of the
     package that is installed (*note Packages with Multiple Outputs::),
     and the location of this package in the store.

     When PATTERN is used, the command returns only matching
     generations.  Valid patterns include:

        • _Integers and comma-separated integers_.  Both patterns denote
          generation numbers.  For instance, ‘--list-generations=1’
          returns the first one.

          And ‘--list-generations=1,8,2’ outputs three generations in
          the specified order.  Neither spaces nor trailing commas are
          allowed.

        • _Ranges_.  ‘--list-generations=2..9’ prints the specified
          generations and everything in between.  Note that the start of
          a range must be lesser than its end.

          It is also possible to omit the endpoint.  For example,
          ‘--list-generations=2..’, returns all generations starting
          from the second one.

        • _Durations_.  You can also get the last _N_ days, weeks, or
          months by passing an integer along with the first letter of
          the duration.  For example, ‘--list-generations=20d’ lists
          generations that are up to 20 days old.

‘--delete-generations[=PATTERN]’
‘-d [PATTERN]’
     When PATTERN is omitted, delete all generations except the current
     one.

     This command accepts the same patterns as ‘--list-generations’.
     When PATTERN is specified, delete the matching generations.  When
     PATTERN specifies a duration, generations _older_ than the
     specified duration match.  For instance, ‘--delete-generations=1m’
     deletes generations that are more than one month old.

     If the current generation matches, it is deleted atomically—i.e.,
     by switching to the previous available generation.  Note that the
     zeroth generation is never deleted.

     Note that deleting generations prevents roll-back to them.
     Consequently, this command must be used with care.

3.3 Packages with Multiple Outputs
==================================

Often, packages defined in Guix have a single "output"—i.e., the source
package leads exactly one directory in the store.  When running ‘guix
package -i glibc’, one installs the default output of the GNU libc
package; the default output is called ‘out’, but its name can be omitted
as shown in this command.  In this particular case, the default output
of ‘glibc’ contains all the C header files, shared libraries, static
libraries, Info documentation, and other supporting files.

   Sometimes it is more appropriate to separate the various types of
files produced from a single source package into separate outputs.  For
instance, the GLib C library (used by GTK+ and related packages)
installs more than 20 MiB of reference documentation as HTML pages.  To
save space for users who do not need it, the documentation goes to a
separate output, called ‘doc’.  To install the main GLib output, which
contains everything but the documentation, one would run:

     guix package -i glib

   The command to install its documentation is:

     guix package -i glib:doc

   Some packages install programs with different “dependency
footprints”.  For instance, the WordNet package install both
command-line tools and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The former
depend solely on the C library, whereas the latter depend on Tcl/Tk and
the underlying X libraries.  In this case, we leave the command-line
tools in the default output, whereas the GUIs are in a separate output.
This allows users who do not need the GUIs to save space.

   There are several such multiple-output packages in the GNU
distribution.  Other conventional output names include ‘lib’ for
libraries and possibly header files, ‘bin’ for stand-alone programs, and
‘debug’ for debugging information (*note Installing Debugging Files::).
The outputs of a packages are listed in the third column of the output
of ‘guix package --list-available’ (*note Invoking guix package::).

3.4 Invoking ‘guix gc’
======================

Packages that are installed but not used may be "garbage-collected".
The ‘guix gc’ command allows users to explicitly run the garbage
collector to reclaim space from the ‘/nix/store’ directory.

   The garbage collector has a set of known "roots": any file under
‘/nix/store’ reachable from a root is considered "live" and cannot be
deleted; any other file is considered "dead" and may be deleted.  The
set of garbage collector roots includes default user profiles, and may
be augmented with ‘guix build --root’, for example (*note Invoking guix
build::).

   Prior to running ‘guix gc --collect-garbage’ to make space, it is
often useful to remove old generations from user profiles; that way, old
package builds referenced by those generations can be reclaimed.  This
is achieved by running ‘guix package --delete-generations’ (*note
Invoking guix package::).

   The ‘guix gc’ command has three modes of operation: it can be used to
garbage-collect any dead files (the default), to delete specific files
(the ‘--delete’ option), or to print garbage-collector information.  The
available options are listed below:

‘--collect-garbage[=MIN]’
‘-C [MIN]’
     Collect garbage—i.e., unreachable ‘/nix/store’ files and
     sub-directories.  This is the default operation when no option is
     specified.

     When MIN is given, stop once MIN bytes have been collected.  MIN
     may be a number of bytes, or it may include a unit as a suffix,
     such as ‘MiB’ for mebibytes and ‘GB’ for gigabytes.

     When MIN is omitted, collect all the garbage.

‘--delete’
‘-d’
     Attempt to delete all the store files and directories specified as
     arguments.  This fails if some of the files are not in the store,
     or if they are still live.

‘--list-dead’
     Show the list of dead files and directories still present in the
     store—i.e., files and directories no longer reachable from any
     root.

‘--list-live’
     Show the list of live store files and directories.

   In addition, the references among existing store files can be
queried:

‘--references’
‘--referrers’
     List the references (respectively, the referrers) of store files
     given as arguments.

‘--requisites’
‘-R’
     List the requisites of the store files passed as arguments.
     Requisites include the store files themselves, their references,
     and the references of these, recursively.  In other words, the
     returned list is the "transitive closure" of the store files.


File: guix.info,  Node: Invoking guix pull,  Prev: Invoking guix gc,  Up: Package Management

3.5 Invoking ‘guix pull’
========================

Packages are installed or upgraded to the latest version available in
the distribution currently available on your local machine.  To update
that distribution, along with the Guix tools, you must run ‘guix pull’:
the command downloads the latest Guix source code and package
descriptions, and deploys it.

   On completion, ‘guix package’ will use packages and package versions
from this just-retrieved copy of Guix.  Not only that, but all the Guix
commands and Scheme modules will also be taken from that latest version.
New ‘guix’ sub-commands added by the update also become available.

   The ‘guix pull’ command is usually invoked with no arguments, but it
supports the following options:

‘--verbose’
     Produce verbose output, writing build logs to the standard error
     output.

‘--bootstrap’
     Use the bootstrap Guile to build the latest Guix.  This option is
     only useful to Guix developers.

4 Programming Interface
***********************

GNU Guix provides several Scheme programming interfaces (APIs) to
define, build, and query packages.  The first interface allows users to
write high-level package definitions.  These definitions refer to
familiar packaging concepts, such as the name and version of a package,
its build system, and its dependencies.  These definitions can then be
turned into concrete build actions.

   Build actions are performed by the Guix daemon, on behalf of users.
In a standard setup, the daemon has write access to the store—the
‘/nix/store’ directory—whereas users do not.  The recommended setup also
has the daemon perform builds in chroots, under a specific build users,
to minimize interference with the rest of the system.

   Lower-level APIs are available to interact with the daemon and the
store.  To instruct the daemon to perform a build action, users actually
provide it with a "derivation".  A derivation is a low-level
representation of the build actions to be taken, and the environment in
which they should occur—derivations are to package definitions what
assembly is to C programs.

   This chapter describes all these APIs in turn, starting from
high-level package definitions.

File: guix.info,  Node: Defining Packages,  Next: The Store,  Up: Programming Interface

4.1 Defining Packages
=====================

The high-level interface to package definitions is implemented in the
‘(guix packages)’ and ‘(guix build-system)’ modules.  As an example, the
package definition, or "recipe", for the GNU Hello package looks like
this:

     (use-modules (guix packages)
                  (guix download)
                  (guix build-system gnu)
                  (guix licenses))

     (define hello
       (package
         (name "hello")
         (version "2.8")
         (source (origin
                  (method url-fetch)
                  (uri (string-append "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-" version
                                      ".tar.gz"))
                  (sha256
                   (base32 "0wqd8sjmxfskrflaxywc7gqw7sfawrfvdxd9skxawzfgyy0pzdz6"))))
         (build-system gnu-build-system)
         (inputs `(("gawk" ,gawk)))
         (synopsis "GNU Hello")
         (description "Yeah...")
         (home-page "http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/")
         (license gpl3+)))

Without being a Scheme expert, the reader may have guessed the meaning
of the various fields here.  This expression binds variable HELLO to a
‘<package>’ object, which is essentially a record (*note Scheme records:
(guile)SRFI-9.).  This package object can be inspected using procedures
found in the ‘(guix packages)’ module; for instance, ‘(package-name
hello)’ returns—surprise!—‘"hello"’.

   There are a few points worth noting in the above package definition:

   • The ‘source’ field of the package is an ‘<origin>’ object.  Here,
     the ‘url-fetch’ method from ‘(guix download)’ is used, meaning that
     the source is a file to be downloaded over FTP or HTTP.

     The ‘mirror://gnu’ prefix instructs ‘url-fetch’ to use one of the
     GNU mirrors defined in ‘(guix download)’.

     The ‘sha256’ field specifies the expected SHA256 hash of the file
     being downloaded.  It is mandatory, and allows Guix to check the
     integrity of the file.  The ‘(base32 …)’ form introduces the base32
     representation of the hash.  You can obtain this information with
     ‘guix download’ (*note Invoking guix download::) and ‘guix hash’
     (*note Invoking guix hash::).

   • The ‘build-system’ field is set to GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM.  The
     GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM variable is defined in the ‘(guix build-system
     gnu)’ module, and is bound to a ‘<build-system>’ object.

     Naturally, GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM represents the familiar GNU Build
     System, and variants thereof (*note configuration and makefile
     conventions: (standards)Configuration.).  In a nutshell, packages
     using the GNU Build System may be configured, built, and installed
     with the usual ‘./configure && make && make check && make install’
     command sequence.  This is what GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM does.

     In addition, GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM ensures that the “standard”
     environment for GNU packages is available.  This includes tools
     such as GCC, Coreutils, Bash, Make, Diffutils, and Patch.

   • The ‘inputs’ field specifies inputs to the build process—i.e.,
     build-time or run-time dependencies of the package.  Here, we
     define an input called ‘"gawk"’ whose value is that of the GAWK
     variable; GAWK is itself bound to a ‘<package>’ object.

     Note that GCC, Coreutils, Bash, and other essential tools do not
     need to be specified as inputs here.  Instead, GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM
     takes care of ensuring that they are present.

     However, any other dependencies need to be specified in the
     ‘inputs’ field.  Any dependency not specified here will simply be
     unavailable to the build process, possibly leading to a build
     failure.

   There are other fields that package definitions may provide.  Of
particular interest is the ‘arguments’ field.  When specified, it must
be bound to a list of additional arguments to be passed to the build
system.  For instance, the above definition could be augmented with the
following field initializer:

         (arguments `(#:tests? #f
                      #:configure-flags '("--enable-silent-rules")))

These are keyword arguments (*note keyword arguments in Guile:
(guile)Optional Arguments.).  They are passed to GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM, which
interprets them as meaning “do not run ‘make check’”, and “run
‘configure’ with the ‘--enable-silent-rules’ flag”.  The value of these
keyword parameters is actually evaluated in the "build stratum"—i.e., by
a Guile process launched by the daemon (*note Derivations::).

   Once a package definition is in place(1), the package may actually be
built using the ‘guix build’ command-line tool (*note Invoking guix
build::).  Eventually, updating the package definition to a new upstream
version can be partly automated by the ‘guix refresh’ command (*note
Invoking guix refresh::).

   Behind the scenes, a derivation corresponding to the ‘<package>’
object is first computed by the ‘package-derivation’ procedure.  That
derivation is stored in a ‘.drv’ file under ‘/nix/store’.  The build
actions it prescribes may then be realized by using the
‘build-derivations’ procedure (*note The Store::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: package-derivation STORE PACKAGE [SYSTEM]
     Return the ‘<derivation>’ object of PACKAGE for SYSTEM (*note
     Derivations::).

     PACKAGE must be a valid ‘<package>’ object, and SYSTEM must be a
     string denoting the target system type—e.g., ‘"x86_64-linux"’ for
     an x86_64 Linux-based GNU system.  STORE must be a connection to
     the daemon, which operates on the store (*note The Store::).

Similarly, it is possible to compute a derivation that cross-builds a
package for some other system:

 -- Scheme Procedure: package-cross-derivation STORE PACKAGE TARGET
          [SYSTEM]
     Return the ‘<derivation>’ object of PACKAGE cross-built from SYSTEM
     to TARGET.

     TARGET must be a valid GNU triplet denoting the target hardware and
     operating system, such as ‘"mips64el-linux-gnu"’ (*note GNU
     configuration triplets: (configure)Configuration Names.).

automatically converted from the Nixpkgs distribution using the ‘guix
import’ command.

4.2 The Store
=============

Conceptually, the "store" is where derivations that have been
successfully built are stored—by default, under ‘/nix/store’.
Sub-directories in the store are referred to as "store paths".  The
store has an associated database that contains information such has the
store paths referred to by each store path, and the list of _valid_
store paths—paths that result from a successful build.

   The store is always accessed by the daemon on behalf of its clients
(*note Invoking guix-daemon::).  To manipulate the store, clients
connect to the daemon over a Unix-domain socket, send it requests, and
read the result—these are remote procedure calls, or RPCs.

   The ‘(guix store)’ module provides procedures to connect to the
daemon, and to perform RPCs.  These are described below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-connection [FILE] [#:reserve-space? #t]
     Connect to the daemon over the Unix-domain socket at FILE.  When
     RESERVE-SPACE? is true, instruct it to reserve a little bit of
     extra space on the file system so that the garbage collector can
     still operate, should the disk become full.  Return a server
     object.

     FILE defaults to %DEFAULT-SOCKET-PATH, which is the normal location
     given the options that were passed to ‘configure’.

 -- Scheme Procedure: close-connection SERVER
     Close the connection to SERVER.

 -- Scheme Variable: current-build-output-port
     This variable is bound to a SRFI-39 parameter, which refers to the
     port where build and error logs sent by the daemon should be
     written.

   Procedures that make RPCs all take a server object as their first
argument.

 -- Scheme Procedure: valid-path? SERVER PATH
     Return ‘#t’ when PATH is a valid store path.

 -- Scheme Procedure: add-text-to-store SERVER NAME TEXT [REFERENCES]
     Add TEXT under file NAME in the store, and return its store path.
     REFERENCES is the list of store paths referred to by the resulting
     store path.

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-derivations SERVER DERIVATIONS
     Build DERIVATIONS (a list of ‘<derivation>’ objects or derivation
     paths), and return when the worker is done building them.  Return
     ‘#t’ on success.

   This section is currently incomplete.


File: guix.info,  Node: Derivations,  Prev: The Store,  Up: Programming Interface

4.3 Derivations
===============

Low-level build actions and the environment in which they are performed
are represented by "derivations".  A derivation contain the following
pieces of information:

   • The outputs of the derivation—derivations produce at least one file
     or directory in the store, but may produce more.

   • The inputs of the derivations, which may be other derivations or
     plain files in the store (patches, build scripts, etc.)

   • The system type targeted by the derivation—e.g., ‘x86_64-linux’.

   • The file name of a build script in the store, along with the
     arguments to be passed.

   • A list of environment variables to be defined.

   Derivations allow clients of the daemon to communicate build actions
to the store.  They exist in two forms: as an in-memory representation,
both on the client- and daemon-side, and as files in the store whose
name end in ‘.drv’—these files are referred to as "derivation paths".
Derivations paths can be passed to the ‘build-derivations’ procedure to
perform the build actions they prescribe (*note The Store::).

   The ‘(guix derivations)’ module provides a representation of
derivations as Scheme objects, along with procedures to create and
otherwise manipulate derivations.  The lowest-level primitive to create
a derivation is the ‘derivation’ procedure:

 -- Scheme Procedure: derivation STORE NAME BUILDER ARGS [#:outputs
          '("out")] [#:hash #f] [#:hash-algo #f] [#:hash-mode #f]
          [#:inputs '()] [#:env-vars '()] [#:system (%current-system)]
          [#:references-graphs #f]
     Build a derivation with the given arguments, and return the
     resulting ‘<derivation>’ object.

     When HASH, HASH-ALGO, and HASH-MODE are given, a "fixed-output
     derivation" is created—i.e., one whose result is known in advance,
     such as a file download.

     When REFERENCES-GRAPHS is true, it must be a list of file
     name/store path pairs.  In that case, the reference graph of each
     store path is exported in the build environment in the
     corresponding file, in a simple text format.

Here’s an example with a shell script as its builder, assuming STORE is
an open connection to the daemon, and BASH points to a Bash executable
in the store:

     (use-modules (guix utils)
                  (guix store)
                  (guix derivations))

     (let ((builder   ; add the Bash script to the store
             (add-text-to-store store "my-builder.sh"
                                "echo hello world > $out\n" '())))
       (derivation store "foo"
                   bash `("-e" ,builder)
                   #:env-vars '(("HOME" . "/homeless"))))
     ⇒ #<derivation /nix/store/…-foo.drv => /nix/store/…-foo>

   As can be guessed, this primitive is cumbersome to use directly.  An
improved variant is ‘build-expression->derivation’, which allows the
caller to directly pass a Guile expression as the build script:

 -- Scheme Procedure: build-expression->derivation STORE NAME SYSTEM EXP
          INPUTS [#:outputs '("out")] [#:hash #f] [#:hash-algo #f]
          [#:env-vars '()] [#:modules '()] [#:references-graphs #f]
          [#:guile-for-build #f]
     Return a derivation that executes Scheme expression EXP as a
     builder for derivation NAME.  INPUTS must be a list of ‘(name
     drv-path sub-drv)’ tuples; when SUB-DRV is omitted, ‘"out"’ is
     assumed.  MODULES is a list of names of Guile modules from the
     current search path to be copied in the store, compiled, and made
     available in the load path during the execution of EXP—e.g.,
     ‘((guix build utils) (guix build gnu-build-system))’.

     EXP is evaluated in an environment where ‘%outputs’ is bound to a
     list of output/path pairs, and where ‘%build-inputs’ is bound to a
     list of string/output-path pairs made from INPUTS.  Optionally,
     ENV-VARS is a list of string pairs specifying the name and value of
     environment variables visible to the builder.  The builder
     terminates by passing the result of EXP to ‘exit’; thus, when EXP
     returns ‘#f’, the build is considered to have failed.

     EXP is built using GUILE-FOR-BUILD (a derivation).  When
     GUILE-FOR-BUILD is omitted or is ‘#f’, the value of the
     ‘%guile-for-build’ fluid is used instead.

     See the ‘derivation’ procedure for the meaning of
     REFERENCES-GRAPHS.

Here’s an example of a single-output derivation that creates a directory
containing one file:

     (let ((builder '(let ((out (assoc-ref %outputs "out")))
                       (mkdir out)    ; create /nix/store/…-goo
                       (call-with-output-file (string-append out "/test")
                         (lambda (p)
                           (display '(hello guix) p))))))
       (build-expression->derivation store "goo" (%current-system)
                                     builder '()))

     ⇒ #<derivation /nix/store/…-goo.drv => …>

   Remember that the build expression passed to
‘build-expression->derivation’ is run by a separate Guile process than
the one that calls ‘build-expression->derivation’: it is run by a Guile
process launched by the daemon, typically in a chroot.  So, while there
is a single language for both the "host" and the build side, there are
really two "strata" of code: the host-side, and the build-side code(1).
This distinction is important to keep in mind, notably when using
higher-level constructs such as GNU-BUILD-SYSTEM (*note Defining
Packages::).  For this reason, Guix modules that are meant to be used in
the build stratum are kept in the ‘(guix build …)’ name space.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The term "stratum" in this context was coined by Manuel Serrano
et al.  in the context of their work on Hop.

5.1 Invoking ‘guix build’
=========================

The ‘guix build’ command builds packages or derivations and their
dependencies, and prints the resulting store paths.  Note that it does
not modify the user’s profile—this is the job of the ‘guix package’
command (*note Invoking guix package::).  Thus, it is mainly useful for
distribution developers.

   The general syntax is:

     guix build OPTIONS PACKAGE-OR-DERIVATION…

   PACKAGE-OR-DERIVATION may be either the name of a package found in
the software distribution such as ‘coreutils’ or ‘coreutils-8.20’, or a
derivation such as ‘/nix/store/…-coreutils-8.19.drv’.  Alternatively,
the ‘--expression’ option may be used to specify a Scheme expression
that evaluates to a package; this is useful when disambiguation among
several same-named packages or package variants is needed.

   The OPTIONS may be zero or more of the following:

‘--expression=EXPR’
‘-e EXPR’
     Build the package EXPR evaluates to.

     For example, EXPR may be ‘(@ (gnu packages guile) guile-1.8)’,
     which unambiguously designates this specific variant of version 1.8
     of Guile.

‘--source’
‘-S’
     Build the packages’ source derivations, rather than the packages
     themselves.

     For instance, ‘guix build -S gcc’ returns something like
     ‘/nix/store/…-gcc-4.7.2.tar.bz2’, which is GCC’s source tarball.

‘--system=SYSTEM’
‘-s SYSTEM’
     Attempt to build for SYSTEM—e.g., ‘i686-linux’—instead of the
     host’s system type.

     An example use of this is on Linux-based systems, which can emulate
     different personalities.  For instance, passing
     ‘--system=i686-linux’ on an ‘x86_64-linux’ system allows users to
     build packages in a complete 32-bit environment.

‘--target=TRIPLET’
     Cross-build for TRIPLET, which must be a valid GNU triplet, such as
     ‘"mips64el-linux-gnu"’ (*note GNU configuration triplets:
     (configure)Configuration Names.).

‘--derivations’
‘-d’
     Return the derivation paths, not the output paths, of the given
     packages.

‘--keep-failed’
‘-K’
     Keep the build tree of failed builds.  Thus, if a build fail, its
     build tree is kept under ‘/tmp’, in a directory whose name is shown
     at the end of the build log.  This is useful when debugging build
     issues.

‘--dry-run’
‘-n’
     Do not build the derivations.

‘--fallback’
     When substituting a pre-built binary fails, fall back to building
     packages locally.

‘--no-substitutes’
     Build instead of resorting to pre-built substitutes.

‘--max-silent-time=SECONDS’
     When the build or substitution process remains silent for more than
     SECONDS, terminate it and report a build failure.

‘--cores=N’
‘-c N’
     Allow the use of up to N CPU cores for the build.  The special
     value ‘0’ means to use as many CPU cores as available.

‘--root=FILE’
‘-r FILE’
     Make FILE a symlink to the result, and register it as a garbage
     collector root.

‘--verbosity=LEVEL’
     Use the given verbosity level.  LEVEL must be an integer between 0
     and 5; higher means more verbose output.  Setting a level of 4 or
     more may be helpful when debugging setup issues with the build
     daemon.

   Behind the scenes, ‘guix build’ is essentially an interface to the
‘package-derivation’ procedure of the ‘(guix packages)’ module, and to
the ‘build-derivations’ procedure of the ‘(guix store)’ module.

5.2 Invoking ‘guix download’
============================

When writing a package definition, developers typically need to download
the package’s source tarball, compute its SHA256 hash, and write that
hash in the package definition (*note Defining Packages::).  The ‘guix
download’ tool helps with this task: it downloads a file from the given
URI, adds it to the store, and prints both its file name in the store
and its SHA256 hash.

   The fact that the downloaded file is added to the store saves
bandwidth: when the developer eventually tries to build the newly
defined package with ‘guix build’, the source tarball will not have to
be downloaded again because it is already in the store.  It is also a
convenient way to temporarily stash files, which may be deleted
eventually (*note Invoking guix gc::).

   The ‘guix download’ command supports the same URIs as used in package
definitions.  In particular, it supports ‘mirror://’ URIs.  ‘https’ URIs
(HTTP over TLS) are supported _provided_ the Guile bindings for GnuTLS
are available in the user’s environment; when they are not available, an
error is raised.

   The following option is available:

‘--format=FMT’
‘-f FMT’
     Write the hash in the format specified by FMT.  For more
     information on the valid values for FMT, *note Invoking guix
     hash::.

5.3 Invoking ‘guix hash’
========================

The ‘guix hash’ command computes the SHA256 hash of a file.  It is
primarily a convenience tool for anyone contributing to the
distribution: it computes the cryptographic hash of a file, which can be
used in the definition of a package (*note Defining Packages::).

   The general syntax is:

     guix hash OPTION FILE

   ‘guix hash’ has the following option:

‘--format=FMT’
‘-f FMT’
     Write the hash in the format specified by FMT.

     Supported formats: ‘nix-base32’, ‘base32’, ‘base16’ (‘hex’ and
     ‘hexadecimal’ can be used as well).

     If the ‘--format’ option is not specified, ‘guix hash’ will output
     the hash in ‘nix-base32’.  This representation is used in the
     definitions of packages.


File: guix.info,  Node: Invoking guix refresh,  Prev: Invoking guix hash,  Up: Utilities

5.4 Invoking ‘guix refresh’
===========================

The primary audience of the ‘guix refresh’ command is developers of the
GNU software distribution.  By default, it reports any packages provided
by the distribution that are outdated compared to the latest upstream
version, like this:

     $ guix refresh
     gnu/packages/gettext.scm:29:13: gettext would be upgraded from 0.18.1.1 to 0.18.2.1
     gnu/packages/glib.scm:77:12: glib would be upgraded from 2.34.3 to 2.37.0

   It does so by browsing each package’s FTP directory and determining
the highest version number of the source tarballs therein(1).

   When passed ‘--update’, it modifies distribution source files to
update the version numbers and source tarball hashes of those packages’
recipes (*note Defining Packages::).  This is achieved by downloading
each package’s latest source tarball and its associated OpenPGP
signature, authenticating the downloaded tarball against its signature
using ‘gpg’, and finally computing its hash.  When the public key used
to sign the tarball is missing from the user’s keyring, an attempt is
made to automatically retrieve it from a public key server; when it’s
successful, the key is added to the user’s keyring; otherwise, ‘guix
refresh’ reports an error.

   The following options are supported:

‘--update’
‘-u’
     Update distribution source files (package recipes) in place.  *note
     Defining Packages::, for more information on package definitions.

‘--select=[SUBSET]’
‘-s SUBSET’
     Select all the packages in SUBSET, one of ‘core’ or ‘non-core’.

     The ‘core’ subset refers to all the packages at the core of the
     distribution—i.e., packages that are used to build “everything
     else”.  This includes GCC, libc, Binutils, Bash, etc.  Usually,
     changing one of these packages in the distribution entails a
     rebuild of all the others.  Thus, such updates are an inconvenience
     to users in terms of build time or bandwidth used to achieve the
     upgrade.

     The ‘non-core’ subset refers to the remaining packages.  It is
     typically useful in cases where an update of the core packages
     would be inconvenient.

   In addition, ‘guix refresh’ can be passed one or more package names,
as in this example:

     guix refresh -u emacs idutils

The command above specifically updates the ‘emacs’ and ‘idutils’
packages.  The ‘--select’ option would have no effect in this case.

   The following options can be used to customize GnuPG operation:

‘--key-server=HOST’
     Use HOST as the OpenPGP key server when importing a public key.

‘--gpg=COMMAND’
     Use COMMAND as the GnuPG 2.x command.  COMMAND is searched for in
     ‘$PATH’.

6 GNU Distribution
******************

Guix comes with a distribution of free software(1) that form the basis
of the GNU system.  This includes core GNU packages such as GNU libc,
GCC, and Binutils, as well as many GNU and non-GNU applications.  The
complete list of available packages can be seen by running ‘guix
package’ (*note Invoking guix package::):

     guix package --list-available

   Our goal is to build a practical 100% free software distribution of
Linux-based and other variants of GNU, with a focus on the promotion and
tight integration of GNU components, and an emphasis on programs and
tools that help users exert that freedom.

File: guix.info,  Node: Installing Debugging Files,  Next: Package Modules,  Up: GNU Distribution

6.1 Installing Debugging Files
==============================

Program binaries, as produced by the GCC compilers for instance, are
typically written in the ELF format, with a section containing
"debugging information".  Debugging information is what allows the
debugger, GDB, to map binary code to source code; it is required to
debug a compiled program in good conditions.

   The problem with debugging information is that is takes up a fair
amount of disk space.  For example, debugging information for the GNU C
Library weighs in at more than 60 MiB. Thus, as a user, keeping all the
debugging info of all the installed programs is usually not an option.
Yet, space savings should not come at the cost of an impediment to
debugging—especially in the GNU system, which should make it easier for
users to exert their computing freedom (*note GNU Distribution::).

   Thankfully, the GNU Binary Utilities (Binutils) and GDB provide a
mechanism that allows users to get the best of both worlds: debugging
information can be stripped from the binaries and stored in separate
files.  GDB is then able to load debugging information from those files,
when they are available (*note (gdb)Separate Debug Files::).

   The GNU distribution takes advantage of this by storing debugging
information in the ‘lib/debug’ sub-directory of a separate package
output unimaginatively called ‘debug’ (*note Packages with Multiple
Outputs::).  Users can choose to install the ‘debug’ output of a package
when they need it.  For instance, the following command installs the
debugging information for the GNU C Library and for GNU Guile:

     guix package -i glibc:debug -i guile:debug

   GDB must then be told to look for debug files in the user’s profile,
by setting the ‘debug-file-directory’ variable (consider setting it from
the ‘~/.gdbinit’ file, *note (gdb)Startup::):

     (gdb) set debug-file-directory ~/.guix-profile/lib/debug

   From there on, GDB will pick up debugging information from the
‘.debug’ files under ‘~/.guix-profile/lib/debug’.

   The ‘debug’ output mechanism in Guix is implemented by the
‘gnu-build-system’ (*note Defining Packages::).  Currently, it is
opt-in—debugging information is available only for those packages whose
definition explicitly declares a ‘debug’ output.  This may be changed to
opt-out in the future, if our build farm servers can handle the load.
To check whether a package has a ‘debug’ output, use ‘guix package
--list-available’ (*note Invoking guix package::).


File: guix.info,  Node: Package Modules,  Next: Packaging Guidelines,  Prev: Installing Debugging Files,  Up: GNU Distribution

6.2 Package Modules
===================

From a programming viewpoint, the package definitions of the
distribution are provided by Guile modules in the ‘(gnu packages ...)’
name space (*note Guile modules: (guile)Modules.).  For instance, the
‘(gnu packages emacs)’ module exports a variable named ‘emacs’, which is
bound to a ‘<package>’ object (*note Defining Packages::).  The ‘(gnu
packages)’ module provides facilities for searching for packages.

   The distribution is fully "bootstrapped" and "self-contained": each
package is built based solely on other packages in the distribution.
The root of this dependency graph is a small set of "bootstrap
binaries", provided by the ‘(gnu packages bootstrap)’ module.  For more
information on bootstrapping, *note Bootstrapping::.


File: guix.info,  Node: Packaging Guidelines,  Next: Bootstrapping,  Prev: Package Modules,  Up: GNU Distribution

6.3 Packaging Guidelines
========================

The GNU distribution is nascent and may well lack some of your favorite
packages.  This section describes how you can help make the distribution
grow.  *Note Contributing::, for additional information on how you can
help.

   Free software packages are usually distributed in the form of "source
code tarballs"—typically ‘tar.gz’ files that contain all the source
files.  Adding a package to the distribution means essentially two
things: adding a "recipe" that describes how to build the package,
including a list of other packages required to build it, and adding
"package meta-data" along with that recipe, such as a description and
licensing information.

   In Guix all this information is embodied in "package definitions".
Package definitions provide a high-level view of the package.  They are
written using the syntax of the Scheme programming language; in fact,
for each package we define a variable bound to the package definition,
and export that variable from a module (*note Package Modules::).
However, in-depth Scheme knowledge is _not_ a prerequisite for creating
packages.  For more information on package definitions, *note Defining
Packages::.

   Once a package definition is in place, stored in a file in the Guix
source tree, it can be tested using the ‘guix build’ command (*note
Invoking guix build::).  For example, assuming the new package is called
‘gnew’, you may run this command from the Guix build tree:

     ./pre-inst-env guix build gnew --keep-failed

   Using ‘--keep-failed’ makes it easier to debug build failures since
it provides access to the failed build tree.

   Once your package builds correctly, please send us a patch (*note
Contributing::).  Well, if you need help, we will be happy to help you
too.  Once the patch is committed in the Guix repository, the new
package automatically gets built on the supported platforms by our
continuous integration system (http://hydra.gnu.org/gnu/master).

   Users can obtain the new package definition simply by running ‘guix
pull’ (*note Invoking guix pull::).  When ‘hydra.gnu.org’ is done
building the package, installing the package automatically downloads
binaries from there (except when using ‘--no-substitutes’).  The only
place where human intervention is needed is to review and apply the
patch.

File: guix.info,  Node: Software Freedom,  Next: Package Naming,  Up: Packaging Guidelines

6.3.1 Software Freedom
----------------------

The GNU operating system has been developed so that users can have
freedom in their computing.  GNU is "free software", meaning that users
have the four essential freedoms
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): to run the program, to
study and change the program in source code form, to redistribute exact
copies, and to distribute modified versions.  Packages found in the GNU
distribution provide only software that conveys these four freedoms.

   In addition, the GNU distribution follow the free software
distribution guidelines
(http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Among other things, these guidelines reject non-free firmware,
recommendations of non-free software, and discuss ways to deal with
trademarks and patents.


File: guix.info,  Node: Package Naming,  Next: Version Numbers,  Prev: Software Freedom,  Up: Packaging Guidelines

6.3.2 Package Naming
--------------------

A package has actually two names associated with it: First, there is the
name of the _Scheme variable_, the one following ‘define-public’.  By
this name, the package can be made known in the Scheme code, for
instance as input to another package.  Second, there is the string in
the ‘name’ field of a package definition.  This name is used by package
management commands such as ‘guix package’ and ‘guix build’.

   Both are usually the same and correspond to the lowercase conversion
of the project name chosen upstream.  For instance, the GNUnet project
is packaged as ‘gnunet’.  We do not add ‘lib’ prefixes for library
packages, unless these are already part of the official project name.
But see *note Python Modules:: for special rules concerning modules for
the Python language.


File: guix.info,  Node: Version Numbers,  Next: Python Modules,  Prev: Package Naming,  Up: Packaging Guidelines

6.3.3 Version Numbers
---------------------

We usually package only the latest version of a given free software
project.  But sometimes, for instance for incompatible library versions,
two (or more) versions of the same package are needed.  These require
different Scheme variable names.  We use the name as defined in *note
Package Naming:: for the most recent version; previous versions use the
same name, suffixed by ‘-’ and the smallest prefix of the version number
that may distinguish the two versions.

   The name inside the package definition is the same for all versions
of a package and does not contain any version number.

   For instance, the versions 2.24.20 and 3.9.12 of GTK+ may be packaged
as follows:

     (define-public gtk+
       (package
        (name "gtk+")
        (version "3.9.12")
        ...))
     (define-public gtk+-2
       (package
        (name "gtk+")
        (version "2.24.20")
        ...))
   If we also wanted GTK+ 3.8.2, this would be packaged as
     (define-public gtk+-3.8
       (package
        (name "gtk+")
        (version "3.8.2")
        ...))


File: guix.info,  Node: Python Modules,  Prev: Version Numbers,  Up: Packaging Guidelines

6.3.4 Python Modules
--------------------

We currently package Python 2 and Python 3, under the Scheme variable
names ‘python-2’ and ‘python’ as explained in *note Version Numbers::.
To avoid confusion and naming clashes with other programming languages,
it seems desirable that the name of a package for a Python module
contains the word ‘python’.

   Some modules are compatible with only one version of Python, others
with both.  If the package Foo compiles only with Python 3, we name it
‘python-foo’; if it compiles only with Python 2, we name it
‘python2-foo’.  If it is compatible with both versions, we create two
packages with the corresponding names.

   If a project already contains the word ‘python’, we drop this; for
instance, the module python-dateutil is packaged under the names
‘python-dateutil’ and ‘python2-dateutil’.


File: guix.info,  Node: Bootstrapping,  Next: Porting,  Prev: Packaging Guidelines,  Up: GNU Distribution

6.4 Bootstrapping
=================

Bootstrapping in our context refers to how the distribution gets built
“from nothing”.  Remember that the build environment of a derivation
contains nothing but its declared inputs (*note Introduction::).  So
there’s an obvious chicken-and-egg problem: how does the first package
get built?  How does the first compiler get compiled?  Note that this is
a question of interest only to the curious hacker, not to the regular
user, so you can shamelessly skip this section if you consider yourself
a “regular user”.

   The GNU system is primarily made of C code, with libc at its core.
The GNU build system itself assumes the availability of a Bourne shell
and command-line tools provided by GNU Coreutils, Awk, Findutils, ‘sed’,
and ‘grep’.  Furthermore, build programs—programs that run
‘./configure’, ‘make’, etc.—are written in Guile Scheme (*note
Derivations::).  Consequently, to be able to build anything at all, from
scratch, Guix relies on pre-built binaries of Guile, GCC, Binutils,
libc, and the other packages mentioned above—the "bootstrap binaries".

   These bootstrap binaries are “taken for granted”, though we can also
re-create them if needed (more on that later).

Preparing to Use the Bootstrap Binaries
---------------------------------------

 [image src="images/bootstrap-graph.png" alt="Dependency graph of the early bootstrap derivations" ]

The figure above shows the very beginning of the dependency graph of the
distribution, corresponding to the package definitions of the ‘(gnu
packages bootstrap)’ module.  At this level of detail, things are
slightly complex.  First, Guile itself consists of an ELF executable,
along with many source and compiled Scheme files that are dynamically
loaded when it runs.  This gets stored in the ‘guile-2.0.7.tar.xz’
tarball shown in this graph.  This tarball is part of Guix’s “source”
distribution, and gets inserted into the store with ‘add-to-store’
(*note The Store::).

   But how do we write a derivation that unpacks this tarball and adds
it to the store?  To solve this problem, the ‘guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv’
derivation—the first one that gets built—uses ‘bash’ as its builder,
which runs ‘build-bootstrap-guile.sh’, which in turn calls ‘tar’ to
unpack the tarball.  Thus, ‘bash’, ‘tar’, ‘xz’, and ‘mkdir’ are
statically-linked binaries, also part of the Guix source distribution,
whose sole purpose is to allow the Guile tarball to be unpacked.

   Once ‘guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv’ is built, we have a functioning Guile
that can be used to run subsequent build programs.  Its first task is to
download tarballs containing the other pre-built binaries—this is what
the ‘.tar.xz.drv’ derivations do.  Guix modules such as ‘ftp-client.scm’
are used for this purpose.  The ‘module-import.drv’ derivations import
those modules in a directory in the store, using the original layout.
The ‘module-import-compiled.drv’ derivations compile those modules, and
write them in an output directory with the right layout.  This
corresponds to the ‘#:modules’ argument of
‘build-expression->derivation’ (*note Derivations::).

   Finally, the various tarballs are unpacked by the derivations
‘gcc-bootstrap-0.drv’, ‘glibc-bootstrap-0.drv’, etc., at which point we
have a working C tool chain.

Building the Build Tools
------------------------

Bootstrapping is complete when we have a full tool chain that does not
depend on the pre-built bootstrap tools discussed above.  This
no-dependency requirement is verified by checking whether the files of
the final tool chain contain references to the ‘/nix/store’ directories
of the bootstrap inputs.  The process that leads to this “final” tool
chain is described by the package definitions found in the ‘(gnu
packages base)’ module.

   The first tool that gets built with the bootstrap binaries is GNU
Make, which is a prerequisite for all the following packages.  From
there Findutils and Diffutils get built.

   Then come the first-stage Binutils and GCC, built as pseudo cross
tools—i.e., with ‘--target’ equal to ‘--host’.  They are used to build
libc.  Thanks to this cross-build trick, this libc is guaranteed not to
hold any reference to the initial tool chain.

   From there the final Binutils and GCC are built.  GCC uses ‘ld’ from
the final Binutils, and links programs against the just-built libc.
This tool chain is used to build the other packages used by Guix and by
the GNU Build System: Guile, Bash, Coreutils, etc.

   And voilà!  At this point we have the complete set of build tools
that the GNU Build System expects.  These are in the ‘%final-inputs’
variables of the ‘(gnu packages base)’ module, and are implicitly used
by any package that uses ‘gnu-build-system’ (*note Defining Packages::).

Building the Bootstrap Binaries
-------------------------------

Because the final tool chain does not depend on the bootstrap binaries,
those rarely need to be updated.  Nevertheless, it is useful to have an
automated way to produce them, should an update occur, and this is what
the ‘(gnu packages make-bootstrap)’ module provides.

   The following command builds the tarballs containing the bootstrap
binaries (Guile, Binutils, GCC, libc, and a tarball containing a mixture
of Coreutils and other basic command-line tools):

     guix build bootstrap-tarballs

   The generated tarballs are those that should be referred to in the
‘(gnu packages bootstrap)’ module mentioned at the beginning of this
section.

   Still here?  Then perhaps by now you’ve started to wonder: when do we
reach a fixed point?  That is an interesting question!  The answer is
unknown, but if you would like to investigate further (and have
significant computational and storage resources to do so), then let us
know.


File: guix.info,  Node: Porting,  Prev: Bootstrapping,  Up: GNU Distribution

6.5 Porting to a New Platform
=============================

As discussed above, the GNU distribution is self-contained, and
self-containment is achieved by relying on pre-built “bootstrap
binaries” (*note Bootstrapping::).  These binaries are specific to an
operating system kernel, CPU architecture, and application binary
interface (ABI). Thus, to port the distribution to a platform that is
not yet supported, one must build those bootstrap binaries, and update
the ‘(gnu packages bootstrap)’ module to use them on that platform.

   Fortunately, Guix can _cross compile_ those bootstrap binaries.  When
everything goes well, and assuming the GNU tool chain supports the
target platform, this can be as simple as running a command like this
one:

     guix build --target=armv5tel-linux-gnueabi bootstrap-tarballs

   In practice, there may be some complications.  First, it may be that
the extended GNU triplet that specifies an ABI (like the ‘eabi’ suffix
above) is not recognized by all the GNU tools.  Typically, glibc
recognizes some of these, whereas GCC uses an extra ‘--with-abi’
configure flag (see ‘gcc.scm’ for examples of how to handle this).
Second, some of the required packages could fail to build for that
platform.  Lastly, the generated binaries could be broken for some
reason.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
