of names of Guile modules from the current search path to be copied in
the store, compiled, and made available in the load path during the

EXP is evaluated in an environment where %OUTPUT is bound to the main
output path, %OUTPUTS is bound to a list of output/path pairs, and where
%BUILD-INPUTS is bound to an alist of string/output-path pairs made from

name and value of environment variables visible to the builder.  The
builder terminates by passing the result of EXP to `exit'; thus, when
EXP returns #f, the build is considered to have failed.

EXP is built using GUILE-FOR-BUILD (a derivation).  When GUILE-FOR-BUILD is
omitted or is #f, the value of the `%guile-for-build' fluid is used instead.
